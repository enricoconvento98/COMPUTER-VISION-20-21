# COMPUTER VISION: Boat Detector

## July 23, 2021

# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Activity Goal

Before introducing the main goal of the activity, a brief dip into the main theme is needed. The
project focus on automated analysis of traffic scenes, in particular it focuses on boat traffic in the
sea. The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting boats in the image. Different
approaches have been implemented through the road to get the final result. This report has not only
the purpose of describing final results, but also to provide a full path through the design steps that
have been followed. The image presented in Fig. 1 will be used as a sample image to present the
various steps that make up the algorithm, this is an image belonging to the test dataset used only
as example and not included in the training process.

## 1.2 Project structure

The project is been developed in _C++_ with the OpenCV library. Also machine learning techniques
have been utilized, thus also a small amount of _Python_ code has been make use of. The _object
detection problem_ consists in determining the location and scale of all object instances, if any, that
are present in an image. Thus, the objective of an object detector is to find all object instances of
one or more given object classes regardless of scale, location, pose, view with respect to the camera,
partial occlusions, and illumination conditions. In this case, locating objects by means of a bounding
box and the associated class.

## 1.3 R-CNN: an overview

**1.3.1 R-CNN: standard approach**

The project draws inspiration from the _R-CNN_ object detection algorithm presented into the paper
_Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation written by Ross
Girshick, Jeff Donahue, Trevor Darrell, Jitendra Malik_. This work is published in 2013, since then
several developments have been presented, however many of these are end-to-end learning approaches
that cannot be used in this case. The brilliant idea on which this algorithm is build came from

```
Figure 2: R-CNN: standard scheme
```
mixing up the result from another interesting paper, named _Selective Search for Object Recognition
presented by by J.R.R. Uijlings, K.E.A. van de Sande, T. Gevers and A.W.M._ and the results of
applying CNN to the image classification problem. In short summary, the R-CNN generates around
2,000 category-independent region proposals for the input image, extracts a fixed length feature
vector from each proposal using a CNN, and then classifies each region with category-specific linear
SVMs. The process is summarized and depicted in Fig. 2.

**Selective search** Among the different steps that make up the process, the second step will be fo-
cused in particular, that is the one that concerns the region proposal. The region proposal algorithms
are what makes the difference compared to a brute force sliding window approach, as they decrease
the computational needs, and it should be emphasized that despite this, in this algorithm is not the
lightest in these terms. _Selective search_ is one of the most successful category-independent region
proposal algorithms, in a nutshell, it exploits a hierarchical grouping algorithm to form the basis of
selective search, applying Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocherâ€™s efficient graph based segmentation algo-
rithm to create small partition of images called "initial regions". Then selective search later uses a
greedy algorithm to iteratively group regions together, it merges together region according to color,
size, texture and shape. The _OpenCV_ library provides a set of methods to implement this algorithm,
in the project the function _utilities::selectiveSearch_ encapsulate all of this, it takes as input an image
and return a vector of boxes that represent the result of the algorithm. The results of the "region
grouping" steps are shown in Fig. 6, notice that the algorithm correctly group segmented regions.
As last thing in Fig. 3(d) the final result of the selective search algorithm is shown.

**1.3.2 R-CNN: modification**

Although the approach used closely follows the RCNN lineup, some changes have been made for
various reasons. First of all, the use of the pre-trained model MobileNet. The standard algorithm
to carry out steps three and four uses AlexNet to extract features from the proposed regions and


```

```
```
(d) Selective search: output bounding box

```
then classify them using SVM. This approach was initially followed step by step using VGGNet in
place of AlexNet since the last is relatively obsolete. Basically VGGNet model is taken, from it
the last layers are modified as it is used to extract features, the network is trained, then the SVM
classifier is created, and substantially the model is complete. However, due to the lack of computing
power available, MobileNet was chosen as it is a simple but efficient and not very computationally
intensive convolutional neural network, incorporating the last two steps into one efficiently, namely
it incorporates all the machine learning part in one step. In Tab. 1 it can be seen that MobileNet is
actually much lighter than VGGNet and the accuracy level is almost the same.

## 1.4 Training

In this section the training process is described, to learn the model the two dataset provided in
the project delivery have been used. Boat detection is a complex task, different scales, intra-class
variance and perspective are some of the main problems that need to be faced, then the training
must take into account all of these.

**1.4.1 Data preparation and ground-truth**

One of the main steps that are basically indispensable for this kind of task is the **dataset preparation**.
Assuming that the _ground truth_ information are available, in the following this problem will also be
addressed, the training dataset is composed by two blocks, namely the images and the ground truth


files.

**Ground truth** Ground truth files have been collecting, cooperating with other colleagues using
the functionalities provided by _https://superannotate.com/_ , those files have been extracted for each
image in Kaggle and MAR datasets. In case of object detection task applied for object detection, the
ground truth represents the desired output given an input. The ground truth contains the coordinate
of the "true" bounding box that contains the boat represented by a bounding rectangle, which is
defined by top-left corner coordinates, width and height associated to the bounding boxes. The
structure of the files used in the project related to this is a little different respectively for training
and testing, in particular as regards the training, for each image a file with the same name is
associated but with a .json extension is used as it is easier to treat by scrolling through the images,
while for the test a single .json file was used as in this case it is used as a dictionary in which you
go to look for the values of ground truth to measure the performance, in order to read this kind
files the _json.hpp_ library file is been used. The produced files have been submitted, and they are
the _COCO_Training_Kaggle.json_ , _COCO_Training_MAR.json_ and _mar_annotation_test.json_ which
make up the contents of the folder _GT_.

**Dataset preparation** The dataset preparation is composed of two parts, first for a given image,
from to the ground truth file associated the true bounding box coordinates are extracted for each
box in the image. Now that the ground truth for the image is available, the next step is to apply
the selective search algorithm used to extract the region proposals as show in Fig. 3(d) and then
a selection is made, to speed up the image was scaled by a factor of two. The metric used in this

```
Figure 4: IoU: visual intuition
```
case is the **IoU** (Intersection over Union), it describes the overlap between two boxes, the associated
value ranges between 0 and 1 , if the intersection area is small then the IoU value is closer to zero
and then this mean "bad" overlapping, otherwise if two boxes that completely overlap, the area of
the intersection would be equal to the area of their union, and therefore the IoU would be equal to

1. A better visualization of these facts is shown in Fig. 4.
    The selection phase return, following the paper, what are defined as _positive and negative samples_.
As _positive sample_ the ground truth box is taken, in Fig. 5 that box is highlighted in blue color.
Then for each image a scan of all the proposal boxes obtained in the step before is performed, and
a set of five boxes that have IoU less than 0_._ 3 with the corresponding ground truth rectangle is
grab, defining the so called _negative samples_ point up in red color in Fig. 5. This process is been
implemented in the file named _dataset_preparation.cpp_ , it essentially fills two directories with those
positive and negative samples respectively named _boat_ and _non_boat_. Of course, in the real dataset
preparation the overall process is repeated for each training image, while in the files submitted this


```
Figure 5: Positive and negative samples
```
part can be tested with only two images.

**1.4.2 Transfer-learning**

At this point half of the work has been done, all these samples are saved, and we switch to _Python_
in order to train the network by providing it with the data just collected. What is done is precisely
called tansfer-learning, through this process instead of starting the learning process from scratch, you
start from patterns that have been learned when solving a different problem. In this way you leverage
previous learnings and avoid starting from scratch. To implement it, the pre-trained on ImageNet
model MobileNet v2 is used. The last part of the training process is implemented in the notebook
_training.ipynb_ in which the previous folders must be uploaded. This part cannot be tested since it
need to upload files on Google Drive. After learn the model, it is downloaded and ready to be tested,
in the project the model is saved as _model.pb_. It is necessary to underline that the dataset was built
by joining together the two supplied datasets, respectively Kaggle and MAR, as we wanted to obtain
a model as general as possible. This is done at the cost of losing a bit of performance, as the range
of possible cases is much more varied in this case.

## 1.5 Test

In this section is shown how the test is performed, this is not the only purpose of this section, in
order to provide a better explanation of the results a comparison of strengths and weaknesses will be
made. The testing process can be divided into three areas, the pre-processing part, the actual test
and in the end the post-processing part. All the code needed to test the system can be found in the
_main.cpp_ file that takes support form the _utilities.cpp_ which include several functions that are used
in the main program.

**Pre-processing** The preprocessing part is implemented by the function _utilities::imgPreprocessing_ ,
this subroutine permits applying to the input image a Gaussian smoothing or perform histogram
equalization, the aim of the blur is to remove useless details while the histogram equalization en-
hancement has the purpose of give more strong to the boat patterns. This image processing attempt
was intended to help the algorithm to highlight parts of the image or to remove details, however
from the results it is observed that it is not a fundamental part but a light Gaussian smoothing can
help.


**Main part** At this point, the main algorithm can be executed. As from the lineup, the first step
is to perform selective search, this step takes a lot of time especially if an image belonging to
the MAR dataset, this is in fact one of the weaknesses of R-CNN that will be partially solved by
the developments of this algorithm. However, the number of proposed regions feeding the neural
network can be limited, as the algorithm often provides more than ten thousand sample images.
Once the regions have been extracted, the next play consists on using the previously trained model
for classifying those regions in order selecting those that appear to contain boats. Before applying
the the model the regions that are warped into images of size 224 ÌŠ 224. The module _cv:dnn_ provides
functions to perform this kind of operation, everything done is encapsulated in the function _runDNN_
that is composed by the functions _blobFromImage(),setInput()_ and _forward()_ which in sequence
create a blob from each region that becomes an input for the model, and output for each region a
value that ranges between 0 and 1 which represents the score on the prediction.

**Post-processing** Now it is the time for post-processing, this part is the more complex from an
image processing point of view. The ladder followed is explained in the following:

1. The network outputs a confidence vector, which precisely for each rectangle gives us an accuracy
    value on the result. This vector is immediately useful as it allows you to sort the array of boxes in
    order of confidence using the function _utilities::argSort_ , which in addition to ordering returns
    a predetermined number of boxes in order to thin out the vector of region proposals. The
    number of these boxes is setted to 300 , a trade-off is needed to be made in order to fix this
    threshold since a lot of boxes helps in images in which there are a lot of details or multiple
    objects while a small amount of boxes helps in the opposite case, a threshold must be set in
    any case in order to make the algorithm robust.
2. The sorted vector returned from the previous step is used to perform Non-maxima suppression
    thanks to the function _utilities::runNMS_. This function is based on two thresholds, _confThresh-_
    _old_ and _nmsThreshold_. The algorithm does perform the following step:

```
(a) It starts removing all the boxes with score under confThreshold
(b) After this thinning, from the survived boxes it makes a boxes comparison based on IoU
using the other threshold, it is actual the box with the highest confidence with the those
have survived the first drop out and delete all the ones that have an high overlap but low
confidence.
```
```
The thresholds are set to respectively 0. 2 and 0. 95 , the second threshold that regards nm-
sThreshold is quite high, this come form the fact that NMS only select the number of regions
that are within certain limits but it does not change the geometry of the latter, for this reason
it was preferred to have a soft effect and solve the problem in the following steps. The results
obtained applying NMS to the previous set of boxes is presented in Fig. 6 in particular it can
be observed the result before (a) and after applying this suppression algorithm (b), important
to notice how the algorithm has a strong impact on the number of boxes. NMS is at the same
time one of the strong point of the algorithm and one of the weakest, this algorithm is strongly
correlated with the goodness of the model, if the model is not well trained the confidence
very likely returns unreliable values that cannot be used. To achieve the actual model several
trainings were needed, and the results is not at all satisfactory.
```

```
3. The third step is used to remove all the "uninteresting" areas like sea, constructions or other
    things that do not identify a boat, in particular an edge map is used so that only boxes
    containing strong edges are kept. Basically the process move to an edge map using Canny
    algorithm with the aim of extract the stronger edges. For each box the number of non-zero
    pixels that it delimits in the edge map is counted, through the function _cv::countNonZero_
    and then a filtering operation is performed through an empirically established threshold. This
    passage is not crucial in images where the level of detail is poor. The image presented in Fig.
    7 is a very representative image of this case, to show the effect of the filtering operation the
    thresholds have been modified for the optimal ones, but this has been done to show that this
    type of operation can help by removing areas that the detector should not detect as, in this
    specific case, the sea. The changes can be observed by looking first at Fig. 7(a) and then
    in Fig. 7(b). It is important to remark that there exist cases in which just the NMS returns

```
(a) Edge threshold disabled (b) Connected components
Figure 7: Edge thresholding effect
```
```
regions that correctly match the boat, in those cases, this method does not modify the regions
which are output directly, these cases will be dealt with later.
```
4. The last passage of the test process is the one that connect and return the final bounding
    boxes. The function used is _utilities::densityThresh_ that solves the problem of merging different
    rectangle that surround the same boat. It uses the concept of accumulation cells, the input
    of this step is the set of boxes returned in step 3, and what is done in basically create a gray
    scale image in which the pixels value ranges from 0 to 255 , initially all the pixel have value
    equal to zero, and each box is used as a mask on this gray scale image. Given a box, each
    pixel value is summed "` 1 " in the area surrounded by the box, this for each bounding box.
    This accumulation process builds a density map that show the distribution of the boxes as
    shown in Fig. 8, quite simply if more rectangles overlap, the more the value on the map grows,


```
Figure 8: Density map
```
high density zones have a whitish color. At this point, a thresholding is done with threshold
value _th_ equal to 4 , or in different words it searches for at least four overlapping rectangles.
At this point it is very likely that more connected components are present on the map for
which the function is used _connectedComponents_ to label them and then new rectangles are
built in a geometric way in order to incorporate all the connected component. In Fig. 9 the
labeled component extracted from the sample image is shown, of course, due to the fact that
in the original image only one boat, only one component is visible. Looking at Fig. 11(b) more
labeled components can be visualized.

```

```

**1.5.1 Performance measurement**

In conclusion, it is important to sum up and evaluate the results by comparing the strengths and
weaknesses that the algorithm and its implementation possess and if possible introduce methods
to solve these problems. In this section, several images will present in order to summarize in a
general way all the problematic cases that can be observed running the program. In each image
in the following a comparison with the ground truth can be observed in a visual way and also the
numerical results of the IoU is depicted in the image. In all the following images, the blue bounding
box represent the ground truth, while the red one is the predicted bounding box. In Fig. 10(a) is
depicted the result obtained at the end of this long path that follows all the various steps that the
program takes. The result is one of the best obtained and this is due to the fact that this is a very
simple image in which only one boat is present, the background is not so complex and also the boat
size facilitates detection. On the other hand, Fig. 10(b) show an interesting case of multiple boat
detection, in this case the result could be considered satisfactory since the accuracy is around the
70%but multiple detection is a not trivial problem. Taking up what was said above and looking at

```
(a) Edge threshold disabled (b) Connected components
Figure 10: Simple detection cases
```
Fig. 11(a) it can be observed that the results is not sufficiently good, as multiple boat are enclosed
in the same rectangle. From Fig. 11(b) the cause of the problem can be deduced, the gray color
connected component is transformed into one unique box since it includes more boats, however if you
look carefully you notice that it distinguishes the two different components, however, the thresholding
work makes sure that the result is not the desired one. This problem arises each time that more boats
are very close each other and cannot be solved with the strategies used. On the other hand, it has
been noted that by re-training the classifier and improving it, this problem tends to decrease. The
MAR dataset is more difficult to handle due to the fact that often it presents a confused situation,
rich of details that sometimes present patterns similar to boat. In order to solve this problem a
possible solution is to modify the threshold _th_ in _utilities::densityThresh_ , in particular set an higher
threshold, this can be led to a better result in this singular case but since the final aim is to get a
system that is able to obtain acceptable results in a more variety of cases this can be deleterious.
Among the pathological cases that create problems in the system is the case in which the size of
the boats to be detected is small. In this case, all the post-processing done is a problematic step to
perform. This is due to the fact that NMS algorithm very thin the boxes vector as the probability
values are very low in this case and furthermore the threshold work performed after NMS plays with
overlap values of at least 4 rectangles, consequently if the rectangles are few or even less than the
threshold the algorithm stops. To avoid this, a control is performed on the number of boxes returned


```
(a) Connected components problems (b) Connected components
Figure 11: Thresholding strategy problem
```
by the NMS, if the number of boxes is very low then the result of the NMS is returned as the final
result. This certainly has advantages, i.e. it allows detecting very small boats as in Fig. 12 however
it can cause the detection of boats even if they are not present. An other interesting problem is

```
(a) Small size detection (b) Small size multiple detection
Figure 12: Sizes problems
```
related to the illumination, the ideal for this type of systems is that they work at any moment of the
day with lighting sources that can be different. In Fig. 13 we observe a case in which the algorithm
fails to detect a boat due to a headlight pointed towards the camera in a night context, with the
current implementation there is no way to solve this problem as the boat it is completely obscured
by the light beam.


```
Figure 13: Illumination problems
```
To summarize what has been done, the performance of the algorithm has been exposed, in
particular the problems that afflict it, obviously for convenience not all the results obtained on the
test images have been reported as the cases exposed almost summarize everything. A single not
indifferent factor was not exposed, namely the execution time. This algorithm cannot be used in
real-time applications and does not even guarantee very high precision, as can be seen from the
results. As already said, there are developments of this algorithm such as Faster R-CNN that aim
eliminate the problems of the presented algorithm and improve it. The realization of the entire
project took approximately 130 hours
